## Dog Pool

# Dog pool, an application that allows your loved dog to be walked when you are too busy or sick. Dog pool lets you set up a distance on how far of a walk you are going on. The app finds dogs that need a walk within your walking distance for you to pick up and help out a friendly neighbor. This app allows you to explore new walking paths, lets you dog meet new friends and have your dog walked when you arenâ€™t able to walk him.
